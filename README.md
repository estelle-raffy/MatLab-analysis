# NOTE TO SUPERVISORS 
To review the latest code please look at: 
---> "simulation_3_triangles_err_red_LEVELS_HigherSystem_THESIS_VAR": loads the excel file where I logged python simulation data and produces the gif + variances of modules' areas. Please note that the GIF defines sucess as "reaching the target at t = 60s", I have NOT changed it yet according to our new definition of stability (5s 0 actuation)


---> "simulation_3_triangles_err_red_LEVELS_SolutionSpaceV3": loads either single or multiple excel files stored in folders (different parameter combinations) and plots the solution shapes given our new definition of stability (5s 0 actuation). The script also plots the periods of stability for each control strategies, the actuation signals, multiple successful shapes within and across parameter combinations, morphological clusters... and more. We can go through it together.
